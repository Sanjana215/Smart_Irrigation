# Smart_Irrigation
To monitor the plants health
The key features are:

ESP32 Microcontroller: Integrating sensors and motors for data collection and control.

Arduino IoT Cloud : Building dashboards, asking input, building live graphs for real-time 
monitoring and writing codes and algorithms for controlling irrigation practices and transferring image to MATLAB for pest and disease analysis.

Open Weather Map: It is used to collect the data on weather conditions and transfer it to Arduino Iot cloud by making an HTTP request in Arduino code.

Wokwi Platform: Simulation for testing.

Disease Detection and Pesticide Recomendation: MATLAB image processing and AI algorithms to analyze images and classify leaves on five categories namely ‘Alternaria Alternata', 'Anthracnose', 'Bacterial Blight', 'Cercospora Leaf Spot' and 'Healthy Leaves’ to diagonose disease and pesticides.

Website Integration: A website has been built where it includes all the sub links for monitoring plants helath, detecting the disease,educating farmers about the various loans and benifits avaible to them and buying pesticides.
